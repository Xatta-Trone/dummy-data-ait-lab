      "description": "This study introduces a data-driven framework aimed at prioritizing maintenance activities in metro systems by integrating passenger impact analysis. The framework combines predictive maintenance with passenger flow data, focusing on reducing disruptions during peak demand periods. It employs Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) for passenger flow prediction and One-Class Support Vector Machines (OCSVM) for asset status evaluation. The approach prioritizes maintenance tasks based on asset criticality, passenger impact, and service reliability, demonstrating its effectiveness on Milan's M5 metro line. This framework aligns maintenance scheduling with passenger needs, minimizing service interruptions and optimizing resource allocation.",

Utilizing a longitudinal survey conducted over three waves, the study explores how public perceptions evolve as they gain real-world riding experience.

The dynamic structural equation model indicates that while initial safety concerns play a significant role in early adoption, their influence wanes over time. This research offers critical insights for public transport operators aiming to enhance the user experience and promote automated bus services through targeted marketing strategies.",

      "objective": "This study examines how metro disruptions influence travelers' decisions regarding departure time, trip-chaining, and travel mode. The research focuses on understanding the interconnected nature of these choices during unplanned metro outages, providing insights for improving resilience in urban transit systems.",
      "method": "Using survey data collected from metro users in Shanghai, the study employs a joint choice model that integrates nested logit and mixed logit approaches. The model captures the interdependencies between departure time, trip-chaining, and travel mode choices under varying disruption scenarios. Simulated metro disruptions were introduced to validate the model's predictive capability.",

        "Travelers tend to shift to buses and online ride-hailing services during metro disruptions.",
