        "description": "This paper discusses the integration of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) and Management and Operations (M&O) into institutionalized transportation planning and programming processes. It consolidates experience from Transportation System Management (TSM), congestion management systems (CMS), and ITS deployment planning. The research emphasizes the importance of ITS as a principal means to enhance mobility, safety, and service reliability under real-time conditions. Highlighting driving forces like increasing demand, limited new capacity, and technological advances, the paper proposes an operational framework centered on efficiency and user-oriented performance. Key challenges include institutional collaboration, policy reorientation, technical system integration, and resource allocation. The work serves as a guide to policymakers for advancing regional integration of ITS and promoting innovative, responsive transportation solutions for 21st-century challenges.",

Developed by Florida International University's Lehman Center for Transportation Research, the project integrates two tools: ITS Data Capture and Performance Management (ITSDCAP) and the Integrated Regional Information Sharing and Decision Support System (IRISDS). These systems have been combined into a web-based environment for improved usability, offering real-time and off-line decision-making capabilities. The enhanced system provides functionalities like performance dashboards, benefit-cost analysis for arterial incidents, prediction of arterial breakdowns, and assessment of construction impacts. By incorporating new modules and improving existing ones, the study demonstrates practical applications of decision support for better traffic management and operations planning.",

The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) developed this framework to address gaps in traditional annual crash analysis methods, which often fail to capture the dynamic interactions between traffic signal timing and crash occurrences. The report focuses on probabilistic models applied at signalized intersections to analyze rear-end and right-angle crashes. Through the use of multinomial and binary logistic regression models, the study explores how vehicle arrival characteristics and traffic signal timing influence crash outcomes. Key insights include strategies for minimizing crashes and improving coordination using data-driven approaches, supported by advanced signal timing plans and high-resolution traffic data.",

Performance bias occurs when machine learning models yield inconsistent results across different incident scenarios. The paper investigates dimension-reduction techniques, such as feature selection and Principal Component Analysis (PCA), to reduce this bias. Seven machine learning models (RF, BRNN, SVR, KNN, XGB, GP, and NNET) are tested using incident clearance time data from Missouri interstates. PCA significantly reduces performance bias and improves global error metrics, particularly for scenarios involving severe incidents. The findings suggest that integrating PCA into model development enhances reliability and reduces error variability, making it a valuable tool for improving machine learning applications in TSMO.",

By employing dimension-reduction techniques, the research aims to mitigate inconsistencies and improve model reliability across diverse traffic scenarios.",
        "method": "The study analyzes incident data from three interstate corridors in Missouri, USA. Machine learning models, including Random Forest and Support Vector Regression, are evaluated using Repeated K-Fold Cross-Validation. Dimension-reduction techniques such as feature selection and PCA are applied to examine their effects on model bias and global error metrics. Scenario-specific RMSE is calculated to assess performance variations.",
